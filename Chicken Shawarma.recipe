# Chicken Shawarma

## Marinade the Chicken

> Start in a mixing bowl that can hold 2 lbs chicken + the marinade

- Lemons | 2-count | Juice only
- Olive Oil | 1/2 cup | 
- Garlic | 6-cloves | Minced
- Salt | 1 tsp |

Mix above ingredients, and marinate chicken up to 12 hours (at least 90 minutes)

## Cook the Chicken

Preheat oven to 425°F

- Red Onion | 1-count | Cut into long slices, place on top of the marinade bowl and stir immediately before baking

Place chicken on tinfoil lined baking sheet

Bake for 30 minutes

> This always sets off my smoke alarms, so maybe open a window, or press the hush button

Cool for at least 2 minutes

Cut chicken into cubes

## Prepare the Pita

- Pita Pocket (or Naan) |  | 
- Hummus |  | 
- Cucumber |  | Cut in spindles
- Tomato |  | Diced

Warm up the Pita/Naan

Cut into Pita pocket, or just use Naan folded in half

Spread hummus on pita inside

Fill pita with chicken, then veggies
